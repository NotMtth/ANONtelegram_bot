## Bot deplyment + cold wallet restoration ##


--Wallet restoration + RPC--

-> to get all the binaries you need start the sh file 'monero.sh' with 'sh monero.sh' in it's folder

[generating keys from viewkey over Tor can be very slow and cause problems, in case of errors remove 'torsocks' at the beginning and use a clearnet node.
Keep in mind to remove all stagenet flags if you are using mainnet]
-> type 'torsocks ./monero-wallet-cli --stagenet --daemon-address=<your node>:<your node's port> --untrusted-daemon --generate-from-view-key <your private view key>'

-> follow monero-wallet-cli instructions and let it fully sync

-> after sync close it. Now in the 'monero_wallet' you now should have 3 key files all named as your private viewkey


--Bot deployment--

[Remember to change all the variables at line 8 to 11 like: node, node port, wallet name (it's your private viewkey) and wallet password]

-> start it typing 'sh start.sh' to create virtual environment, install dependecies, create database, run the bot and the RPC all at the same time

The RPC doesn't instantly starts, give it some time. It needs to fully load the wallet keys and fire up the server. 

	
	Check if bot works :)
